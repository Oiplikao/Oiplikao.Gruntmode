# Oiplikao.Gruntmode
R2Northstar mod that adds a new gamemode: **Gruntmode**

It works similar to the Hidden or Juggernaut modes, as in all players fight against a single powerful player, but instead of making that one player stronger, everyone else is made weaker.

## Game Mechanics
The teams are Grunts and Pilots. The game chooses 1 Pilot at the start and everyone else turns into a weak Grunt. The game ends once the Pilot is killed (Grunts win) or the time runs out (Pilot wins).
